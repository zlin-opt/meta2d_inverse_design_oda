# Photonic inverse design for 2D meta-lenses using overlapping-domains approximation

- the Maxwell solver is finite-difference frequency-domain (convention exp(-i omega t) )
- it directly computes and maximizes Strehl's ratio (defined as the peak focal intensity compared to ideal diffraction-limited Airy disc)
- uses an epigraph formulation (maximize the mininum) for multiple frequencies and angles. (used to design a single-piece nanophotonic plan-achromat)
- more up-coming! ...
